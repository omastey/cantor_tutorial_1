<p>Hi, welcome to Cantor! This is the first of a series of projects that will help you learn the basics of crucial skills and softwares that companies like to see. This tutorial will include introductions to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Command line + scripting</li>
  <li>Version Control</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Python</h2>
<p>
  Python is a very useful language that has tons of different applications. It also simplifies a lot of long, annoying features of C++. For example, writing a for loop is completely different:
</p>
<p>
<h4>C++</h4>
<code>for(i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++){
    //content
}
</code>
 </p>

<p>
 <h4>Python</h4>
<code>for i in numbers: 
      //content</code>
</p>

<p>
  This is just one of the many differences between the two. Check out this tutorial if you want to get a better sense of the syntax of Python! <ul><li>https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZtHV1NX3bUUY-TeyVyKAIX-c2_BoH4XKeHvgndoEzK8/edit?usp=sharing</li></ul>
