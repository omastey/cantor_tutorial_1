<h2>Python</h2>
<p>
  Python is a very useful language that has tons of different applications. It also simplifies a lot of long, annoying features of C++. For example, writing a for loop is completely different:
</p>
<p>
<h4>C++</h4>
<code>for(i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++){
    //content
}
</code>
 </p>

<p>
 <h4>Python</h4>
<code>for i in numbers: 
      //content
 </code>
</p>

<p>
  This is just one of the many differences between the two. Check out this tutorial if you want to get a better sense of the syntax of Python!
