<p>Hi, welcome to Cantor! This is the first of a series of projects that will help you learn the basics of crucial skills and softwares that companies like to see. This tutorial will include introductions to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Command line + scripting</li>
  <li>Version Control</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Python</h2>
<p>
  Python is a very useful language that has tons of different applications. It also simplifies a lot of long, annoying features of C++. For example, writing a for loop is completely different:
</p>
<p>
<h4>C++</h4>
<code>for(i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++){
    //content
}
</code>
 </p>

<p>
 <h4>Python</h4>
<code>for i in numbers: 
      //content</code>
</p>

<p>
  This is just one of the many differences between the two. Check out this tutorial if you want to get a better sense of the syntax of Python! <ul><li>https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZtHV1NX3bUUY-TeyVyKAIX-c2_BoH4XKeHvgndoEzK8/edit?usp=sharing</li></ul>
</p>

  Once you're feeling good about your Python skills, feel free to put them to the test and solve this Leetcode problem. Leetcode is a really useful resource for improving your coding and problem solving skills, as well as preparing for coding interviews. There's an endless bank of problems to try out!

<h2>Command Line</h2>
<p>
  The command line is a tool that can be utilized to quickly access, traverse, and modify directories. It can also be used to. Create sell scripts to automatically carry out functions. Open up your terminal to start experimenting with different commands! Here are some of the basics:
</p>

<h4><code>pwd</code></h4>
<p>
  <code>pwd</code> is a command which states the current directory you are in. Just type pwd into the command line and press enter and underneath, you will see where you're at.
 </p>

<h4><code>ls</code></h4>
<p>
  <code>ls</code> is a command that will display every item in the current directory. Simply type <code>ls</code> into the terminal anmd press enter.
 </p>
 
 <h4><code>cd</code></h4>
<p>
  <code>cd</code> is a command that is used to traverse through directories. Since you can see all your directories using ls, try entering one using cd. Type <code>cd {directory_name}</code> into your command line then press enter to jump to a folder of your choice. To go back up a directory, simply use <code>cd ..</code>. 
 </p>

 <h4><code>mkdir</code></h4>
<p>
  <code>mkdir</code> is used to create a new directory from the command line. This directory will be made within your current directory. Enter <code>mkdir practice_dir</code> into your command line and then use <code>ls</code>. You should now see practice_dir on your command line. You can enter exit and create files inside practice_dir.
 </p>
 
 <h4><code>touch</code></h4>
<p>
  <code>touch</code> is used to create new files within a directory. From inside practice_dir enter <code>touch practice_file.txt</code> into the command line, and it will create a text file called practice_file.txt. You can modify this file in VS code or in a command line text editor.
 </p>

<h4><code>rmdir</code></h4>
<p>
 In the same way that you can create directories with <code>mkdir</code>, you can also delete them with <code>rmdir</code>. From the directory above practice_dir, try entering <code>rmdir -r practice_dir</code>, and it should erase practice_dir from your files.
</p>

<h4><code>echo</code></h4>
<p>
 <code>echo</code> is used to print something onto the command line. Typing <code>echo {any string}</code> into the command line will have it printed directly underneath. This seems kind of useless, but it is helpful in making larger shell scripts where you are telling the command line to do many commands within one script.
</p>

<h4>Shell scripting</h4>
  <p>Shell scripting is important because it allows you to make more complicated and repeatable command line instructions without having to enter them in one line at a time. For example, you could create a shell script that creates multiple directories within a folder. If you needed to do this multiple times, it would make sense to write a script instead of constantly having to make new directories line by line. Here is a helpful tutorial on shell scripting if you want to learn more:
